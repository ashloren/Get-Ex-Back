					<p class="bodytext"><b>Answer:</b> Of course you don't!</p>

					<p class="bodytext">Are you sure that you have truly "grown apart" and you aren't both simply neglecting one another?</p>
						
						
					<p class="bodytext">If you are determined to tie the knot and <b>can't get him to propose</b> in spite of all the hints and nudging him in that direction that you have attempted thus far, perhaps it is time to honestly ask yourself if you have tried to have a serious, adult discussion regarding your commitments to each other?</p>

					<p class="h1">How to Make Yourself <u>Irresistible</u> to <br>Him After Breaking Up</p>	
					<p class="h2">While Remaining Classy & <br>Never Having to Sacrifice Your Pride</p>
						
					<p class="bodytext">Here is a secret that should make you feel a little better. Regardless of who ended the relationship, I can pretty much guarantee that your ex misses you too. Even if they are glad to be rid of you, there are still moments throughout the day that they find themselves wishing you were still around. This is good news! We obviously want to focus on what they miss about being with you, and do our best to eliminate the reasons they had for breaking things off. </p>
					
					<p class="bodytext">If your ex has broken up with you, then dating other people is fair game! In fact, I recommend trying it after you've spent a brief period of time licking your worst wounds. But as soon as you can dry your eyes long enough to scope out what is available, you should put yourself out there and just make it very clear that you're only looking for some lighthearted fun with someone. After all, that's what dating is supposed to be! 
</p>
					
					<p class="bodytext"></p>
					
					<p class="h1">What if Your Relationship Had a <br>Rewind Button?</p>
					<p class="h2"><u>It DOES</u> - And He Will <u>Fall in Love</u> All Over Again</p>
					
					<p class="bodytext">Immediately after splitting up with a partner, we tend to feel completely lost. This is especially true for long term relationships that have spanned many years. They say you don't know what you have until it's gone, but the opposite is also true. You don't know what you don't have! Only once you are separated from your partner do you realize how much of your own personal identity has withered away or melted into the identity you shared with them as a couple. </p>
					
					<p class="bodytext">While there is certainly nothing wrong with being in a loving and committed relationship with someone, you should always be careful about sacrificing too much of yourself and who you are as an individual. If you are like the majority of couples, you probably have a few different interests than your partner. This is good! Instead of one person always going along with what the other one wants to do, you should try your best to strike a reasonable balance or insist on you both having your own time to enjoy your hobbies.</p>
					
					<p class="bodytext">So if you're sitting there going out of your mind and feel stuck in a rut of depression now that you find yourself alone, I suggest you take a day or two to indulge yourself in whatever way your heart desires. Pamper yourself. Treat yourself. Revamp yourself. Trust me, this will end up being very important in the entire process or rekindling your relationship with your ex.</p>

					<p class="h2">Simple, Straightforward Actions You Can <br> Start Using <u>TODAY</u></p>
					
					<p class="bodytext"></p>
					
					<p class="h1">5 <u>Biggest Mistakes</u> Women Make <br>After They Get Dumped</p>
					<p class="bodytext">It's okay to be vulnerable and passionate about how you feel in this situation, but you must avoid confirming these things in words or obvious actions. You are waiting for him to bite first, then you are probably safe and can spill your heart out to him before he's even finished speaking. Okay, that may be a slight exaggeration. </p>
					
					<p class="bodytext">But seriously, just hold out and insist on him taking that first step before you even think of doing it yourself. That way you will avoid making a fool of yourself or making the wrong assumptions. Chances are that both of you will be fairly aware of one another's present state while together. You are far from strangers, and know each other quite intimately. </p>
